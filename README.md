# Youtaite Network

## Summary
This project is focused on a community of Youtube content creators who often collaborate with each other. I wanted to show how different collaborations are connected to each other through people - for example, if I am in two different collabs, those two collabs are connected through me. I hope to show the existence of different corners within the community, where groups of people collaborate with each other more often than with someone outside of their corner. The frontend website is written in React. The data visualization is created using d3. The backend API is written in Ruby on Rails.
