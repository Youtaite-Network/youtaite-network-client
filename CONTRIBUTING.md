# Contributing

Thanks so much for wanting to contribute! Feel free to email (lyn.youtaite@gmail.com), DM on Twitter (@lynsings), or DM on Discord (lyn 文文#0132) at any time if you have any questions at all. I'll be more than happy to help if I can!

## Writing code

1. Go to the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Youtaite-Network/projects/1/views/1). If you're contributing for the first time, check out the [Good First Issues tab](https://github.com/orgs/Youtaite-Network/projects/1/views/4) and look through the ones that have a status of "Ready to Work".
2. Pick an issue. Read through the description. If you have any questions, feel free to comment on the issue, or ask me directly.
3. If you decide you want to work on it, comment on the issue. I will assign it to you and set the status to "In Progress".
4. Fork both repositories if you haven't already, and clone the forks. If you've already forked the repository before, don't forget to [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) before writing new code.
5. From the main branch of the repository you are writing code in, create a new branch with the issue number (eg, `git checkout -b #29`).
6. Write the code. Any commit messages should contain the issue number and a description of what was done (eg, `#29 Add filtering/sorting to collabs route`).
7. When you're finished, [make a pull request to the original repository's main branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
8. I'll review the code. After the pull request is approved, merge it.
9. If it's a change to the API, the changes will be automatically visible in the [API staging app](https://youtaite-network-api-staging.herokuapp.com). If it's a change to the client, the changes will be visible in the [client staging app](https://youtaite-network-staging.netlify.com).
10. I'll deploy the changes to the production apps when I feel like it :)

## Creating issues

1. If you find a bug, create an issue on the [client repository](https://github.com/youtaite-network/youtaite-network-client/issues) describing the bug and STR (steps to reproduce).
2. If you want to request a feature, create an issue on the [client repository](https://github.com/youtaite-network/youtaite-network-client/issues) describing the feature you are requesting.

## Adding documentation

Always feel free to contribute documentation! Follow the same steps as contributing code, but you don't need to create an issue first. Just fork the relevant repository, clone it, add your changes, and make a pull request. In the pull request, explain briefly what your changes are and the motivation for them. One awesome way to contribute is by taking note of any problems that arise while doing the setup steps in the (README)(README.md), and updating the README accordingly. Or, by updating this CONTRIBUTING document if anything is unclear.
